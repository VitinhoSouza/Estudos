# Welcome to my repository👋
This is **Letmeask**, a system that provides real-time question rooms. It was developed during the **6th edition of NLW**. 🙋‍♂️

The application was developed in **Reactjs**, using the SPA concept. The **Firebase** Authentication and Realtime Database functionalities were used.

A really cool application, but it can still be improved!
